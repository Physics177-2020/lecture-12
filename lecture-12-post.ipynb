    "As a simple model of a ferromagnetic material, we can consider a set of spins arranged on a lattice. The energy of a pair of spins will be lower if they are aligned in the same direction. To make our analysis simple, we'll assume that only **nearest neighbor** spins are coupled together. Spins that aren't nearest neighbors could also interact, but these interactions will be much weaker due to the greater distance between them.\n",

    "Mathematically, we can write the energy of a configuration $\\underline{\\sigma}=\\{\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_N\\}$ of spins $\\sigma_i\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ in a one-dimensional lattice as\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example: Coding the Gibbs distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Like we did in the example with a single spin, let's write a function that returns $P(\\underline{\\sigma})$. To keep things simple, let's limit ourselves to $N=5$ spins. We'll choose $J=1$ and $T=1$."
