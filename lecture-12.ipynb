    "As a simple model of a ferromagnetic material, we can consider a set of spins arranged on a lattice. The energy of a pair of spins will be lower if they are aligned in the same direction. To make our analysis simple, we'll assume that only **nearest neighbor** spins are coupled together. Spins that aren't nearest neighbors could also interact, but these interactions will be much weaker due to the greater distance between them.\n",
